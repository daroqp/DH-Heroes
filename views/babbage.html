		<p> Charles Babbage was an English multidisciplinary scientist who is considered to be one of the fathers of the computer. </p>

		<p> Babbage built a mechanical computer, or a device made of levers, gears, or other moving parts that could compute perform automated calculations rather than a device made of modern computer hardware. The more advanced of his former iterations of a functioning mechanical computer was his Analytical Engine, the 1837 successor to his earlier Difference Engine. These devices could be programmed to perform a set of operations and indeed he proposed his Analytical Engine as a general purpose computer that had more than just straightforward mathematical (such as financial) calculations. </p>
		<p> Babbage is perhaps the foremost contributor to our concept of a modern computer. He is instrumental to our current thinking, having created a computer that is a mechanical prototype to todayâ€™s differently-designed computers, for example having several applications to its use.  </p>
